# MT Socket Programming with Java

This project is the result of my tinkering of with Java's Multithreading and Networking. It is supposed to be the prototype of a basic terminal based chat application. This is a server-client application, in which one computer must assume the role of the server, and then we can initiate two or more terminals to be the clients.

The clients can send messages to the server terminal which can keep the track record of the "chat".

⋅⋅*Run `ServerMain.java` to initate the server terminal. Follow onscreen instructions to complete the process.

⋅⋅*Run `ClientMain.java` to initate a client terminal. Follow onscreen instructions to complete the setup.
